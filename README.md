This simple To-Do List web application is built using React framework on the frontend and Node.js, Express and MongoDB on the backend.

The system includes user authentication, allowing users to register and log in before accessing their personal to-do list. Once logged in, users can create tasks with a title, description, due date and time, view all their tasks retrieved from the API, update and edit tasks, mark them as complete or incomplete and delete them. The app also highlights overdue tasks and can trigger due-date notifications.

All data is stored through secure API calls. 

To run the project, start MongoDB, run the backend server and open the frontend HTML file in a browser.
